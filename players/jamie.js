    player: 'Wilshere',
    info: 'Historically Jamie\'s inspiration has been Robinho due to his huge potential and slightly lacking end product. However, due to reasons we suspect are outside Jamie\'s control, Robinho was convicted of Gang rape in November 2017. Jack Wilshere, however, after showing so much potential, all those years ago has been absent for so much of his prime. However, recent showings and performance have given hope to those around that he may very well turn out to be the player we all know he can be.'
