    'Arun is the Coccyx / tail bone of the Dream Team. Part of the spine but no longer essential. Easy to irritate and quick to judge, he\'s barely above an arsehole',
    'Ok... perhaps that\'s a little harsh. He does show (and work for) Promise and has done since I met him. I think you\'ll agree with me that it\'s about time he started living up to it',
