    info: 'In decline since we\'ve known him - and not from much a peak. Andy is terrible at most sports (apparently he can play tennis but I don\'t believe this). Extremely un-PC - Andy blurs the line between joke and insult (ironic I know), friend and foe, fart and poo. Andy - Let\'s make sure you\'re talked about for FIFA reasons and not off screen antics'
