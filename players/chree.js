  bio: [
    'When he\'s not free writing Java Script or querying some database you can usually find Chree in his natural habitat; screaming \'noob\' at the TV whilst smashing some kid at \'1 v 1\' on Rocket League. For what he may lack in sporting prowess and knowledge of the game, Chree\'s competive gaming pedigree should help him become a big name on the grand stage of FIFA night. And if his skills in the game don\'t set the night on fire; I\'m sure some unwarranted, unconventional and possibly condescending life advice will get everyone talking about the Chree',
